# Collective Decision for Open Set Recognition (CD-OSR)

=================================================================================================================

This is the implementation demo of CD-OSR, and such an implementation mainly relies on the HDP software package 
(http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/software.html,copy right specified in COPYRIGHT file) developed by Yee Whye Teh.

==================================================================================================================

Implementation
1. In 'initpath.m' file: it is executed first, loading the corresponding file paths.
2. In 'CDOSR_demo.m' file: it is the main file, implementing CD-OSR.

==================================================================================================================

REMARK:
1. This code has been sucessfully implemented in MATLAB 2013a (some versions of MATLAB may not work without some components)
2. Make sure to specify all the data-related parameter based on your data.  
3. We also include one sample in the code. You can directly calculating the F-measure and Accuracy by running 'CD-OSR_demo.m'
4. File 'Datasets_CD-OSR' contains all datasets used in our paper 'Collective Decision for Open Set Recognition'.
5. This codes were developed by Chuanxing Geng. For any problem, please feel free to contact Mr.Geng (gengchuanxing@nuaa.edu.cn).
